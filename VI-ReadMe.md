##VI / VIM does one thing at a time, and does well. 

* <B><H3>Easy come, Easy Go in VI / VIM.<H3><B>
 1. <h3> Start from the sence of playing games in VI.<h3>
	 <h4>I believe that you have ever played Computer-Games or Game console before. We can press the keyboard of "[W / ↑], [S / ↓], [A / ←], [D / →]" to control the orientations in the game. As the same way, we can use another 4 keys to control the input-source. By the way, We should be more attention to every single letter, especially for its Uppercase style and Lowercase style, because even the same letter in different style means different operation in VI.
